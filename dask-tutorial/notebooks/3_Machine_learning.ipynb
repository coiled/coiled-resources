    "The material in this notebook was based on the open-source content from [Dask's tutorial repository](https://github.com/dask/dask-tutorial) and the [Machine learning notebook](https://github.com/coiled/data-science-at-scale/blob/master/3-machine-learning.ipynb) from data science at scale from coiled\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have seen how Dask makes data analysis scalable with parallelization via Dask DataFrames. Let's now see how [Dask-ML](https://ml.dask.org/) allows us to do machine learning in a parallel and distributed manner. Note, machine learning is really just a special case of data analysis (one that automates analytical model building), so the 💪 Dask gains 💪 we've seen will apply here as well!\n",

    "## Types of scaling problems in machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of scaling challenges you can run into in your machine learning workflow: scaling the **size of your data** and scaling the **size of your model**. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CPU-bound problems**: Data fits in RAM, but training takes too long. Many hyperparameter combinations, a large ensemble of many models, etc.\n",
    "2. **Memory-bound problems**: Data is larger than RAM, and sampling isn't an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a handy diagram for visualizing these problems:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the bottom-left quadrant, your datasets are not too large (they fit comfortably in RAM) and your model is not too large either. When these conditions are met, you are much better off using something like scikit-learn, XGBoost, and similar libraries. You don't need to leverage multiple machines in a distributed manner with a library like Dask-ML. However, if you are in any of the other quadrants, distributed machine learning is the way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizing: \n",
    "\n",
    "* For in-memory problems, just use scikit-learn (or your favorite ML library).\n",
    "* For large models, use `dask_ml.joblib` and your favorite scikit-learn estimator.\n",

    "* Use `estimator` to inspect attributes, make predictions, etc. \n",
